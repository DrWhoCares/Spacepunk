This sample game is a clone of Combat Tanks for Win 3.1, which itself is a clone of the tank mode in Combat for the Atari 2600 (1977). Two players square off head-to-head in a tank deathmatch.

Bounce shots off of walls to hit your opponent and score a point. There is no score limit.

This game was written entirely in Lua and all of its scripts can be found in the scripts/ directory.

You can customize the controls by modifying autoexec.cfg
